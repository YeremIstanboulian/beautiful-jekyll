title: About me
subtitle: Who am I?
---
I am a recent graduate from UC Santa Barbara where I became one of the first students to graduate from UCSB with a data science degree. My work experience thus far has consisted of working cross-functionally with engineering and finance teams to develop business intelligence tools and foster a lead-with-data culture. In my education, I have made a concerted effort to take as many Machine Learning courses as I could, even going out of my way to take upper division classes outside of my major. I am looking forward to combining my strong background in statistics with my knowledge of machine learning and data visualization to become a valuable data scientist.
